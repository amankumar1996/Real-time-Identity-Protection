# Real-time Identity Protection

**Keywords** - Computer Vision, Python, OpenCV

### Quick Project Description -
  - Developed an application to protect the identity of a person in a live stream or real-time video recording.
  - Worked with OpenCV library to interface the laptop’s webcam and identify faces in an image.
  - Developed a system to display live stream from laptop’s webcam and protect the identities by blurring the faces in the video in real-time.

### Project Repo Navigation
  - `Data` folder contains Haar Cascade classifiers for face detection, which is used by the main program for detecting the faces in the real-time video feed.
  - `real_time_face_blur.py` blurs the faces in the video feed
  - `main_file.py` allows to paste a custom image on the faces in the video feed, instead of blurring
